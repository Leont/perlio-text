#ABSTRACT: Open a text file portably

=encoding utf8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 open my $fh, '<:text(UTF-16LE)', $filename;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a textual pseudo-layer. Instead of pushing itself, it pushes the right layers to open text files in the specified encoding.

=head1 SYNTAX

This modules does not have to be loaded explicitly, it will be loaded automatically by using it in an open mode.  The module has the following general syntax: C<:text(charset)>. C<charset> is mandatory and without it this module will give an error. Any character-set known to L<Encode> may be given as an argument.

=head1 PHILOSPHY

This modules tried to Do The Right Thingâ„¢. That means that it won't do the same on all platforms, and that it may do something smarter in the future (such as Unicode normalization).

=head1 RATIONALE

At first sight this module may seem merely a wrapper around C<:encoding>, and in fact on unix it pretty much is. Its main reason of existence is that many multibyte encodings are not crlf safe, resulting is issues on Windows. A mode of C<< >:encoding(UTF-16LE) >> does the wrong thing by doing crlf translation B<after> the UTF-16 encoding, this causes an output that is not valid UTF-16. Instead this module does something along these lines on Windows: C<< >:raw:encoding(UTF-16-LE):crlf >>, which is correct but horrible from a huffmanization point of view and it adds complexity to your code because now the correct open mode depends on the platform. This module abstracts that complication.
